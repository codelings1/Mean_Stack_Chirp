To export a module use module.exports, and equate it to the variable you want to export from a particular file.

For eg.
In a file movies.js, if you create two functions named A() and B(), you can export one of the functions(A) as
module.exports.func_A = A

Then we can import this in another file as below:
var movies = require("./movies")
movies.func_A();
